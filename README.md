## Description
This is a simple portfolio webpage built with HTML5/CSS3, utilizing JavaScript for DOM manipulation.
## Features
Form validation and an image slideshow have been implemented with JavaScript.

In the future I would like to implement these features: change the websites styles & color palette based on the local machine's time of day; transitional fade-in effects on-scroll for the sections; a navigation hamburger & bar pop-out on-click; and a media queries stylesheet
for responsive design.
## Project Status
With my coursework, I haven't had much time to work on the portfolio lately, but I'm hoping to have it finished before June 2020.
